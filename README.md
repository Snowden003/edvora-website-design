## 📋 Remaining Tasks & Audit

After a preliminary review of the codebase, here are the areas that require further work:

### 1. Unified Brand Palette (Mandatory)
Use only the following colors:
- **Midnight Black:** `#0D0D0D` (Main background, text)
- **Electric Blue:** `#1F8FFF` (Primary actions, headers, buttons)
- **Cyan Glow:** `#00F0FF` (Secondary accents, highlights)
- **Silver Gray:** `#BFC0C0` (Borders, secondary text)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **NO YELLOW.** All action buttons, alerts, and notifications must now use **Electric Blue** with white text or **Cyan Glow** for highlights. Avoid all instances of `#1F8FFF`.

### 2. General Consistency (Global)
- [ ] **Navigation Sync:** Check that all links in the header and footer work correctly across all 20+ HTML files.
- [ ] **Theme Integration:** Ensure dark/light mode uses the palette correctly (Midnight Black for dark backgrounds).
- [ ] **Responsive Design:** Verify that all pages (especially tables in dashboards) are fully responsive.

### 2. Main Pages (Mobin's Focus)
- [ ] **Dynamic Content:** Review `assets/js/main.js` and other page-specific JS files to ensure they correctly populate data placeholders (e.g., upcoming events, popular courses).
- [ ] **Search Functionality:** Implement or improve the search filters on `courses.html` and `teachers.html`.
- [ ] **Contact Form:** Add validation to the contact form in `contact.html`.
- [ ] **Animations:** Polish the "Video Hero" and "Roadmap" animations for smoother transitions.

### 3. Teacher Dashboard (Fatima's Focus)
- [ ] **Course Management:** Finalize the "Create New Course" modal functionality and UI.
- [ ] **Charts Integration:** Ensure `Chart.js` in `teacher-dashboard.js` correctly renders data for earnings and engagement.
- [ ] **Tables:** Improve the "My Courses" table responsiveness and adding "Edit/Delete" actions.
- [ ] **Schedule UI:** Polish the "Today's Schedule" section to look more premium.

### 4. Admin & Student Dashboards (Jawad's Focus)
- [ ] **Admin Statistics:** Implement detailed stats and graphs for platform-wide metrics (users, revenue, etc.).
- [ ] **User Management:** Create or polish the UI for managing students and teachers from the admin panel.
- [ ] **Student Progress:** Improve the "Continue Learning" and "Progress Tracking" UI in the student dashboard.
- [ ] **Auth Flow:** Ensure `login.html` and `signup.html` are properly linked with the dashboard redirect logic in `auth.js`.

## 🔄 Git Workflow Rules

1. **Daily Pull:** Always `git pull origin main` before starting work to avoid conflicts.
2. **Commit Often:** Use descriptive commit messages (e.g., `feat: added course filter UI`).
3. **Pull Requests:** When a task is complete, push to your branch and open a PR. **Do not merge directly to main.**
4. **Code Review:** Review each other's design changes to ensure the UI remains cohesive.
