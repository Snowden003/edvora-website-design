## 📋 Remaining Tasks & Audit

After a preliminary review of the codebase, here are the areas that require further work:

### 1. General Consistency (Global)
- [ ] **Unified Color Palette:** Ensure the primary blue (`#1F8FFF` / `#0337CD`) and orange/warning colors are consistent across all pages and dashboards.
- [ ] **Navigation Sync:** Check that all links in the header and footer work correctly and point to the right files across all 20+ HTML files.
- [ ] **Dark/Light Mode:** Implement or polish the theme toggle functionality to ensure all components respond correctly to theme changes.
- [ ] **Responsive Design:** Verify that all pages (especially tables in dashboards) are fully responsive on mobile and tablet views.

### 2. Main Pages (Mobin's Focus)
- [ ] **Dynamic Content:** Review `assets/js/main.js` and other page-specific JS files to ensure they correctly populate data placeholders (e.g., upcoming events, popular courses).
- [ ] **Search Functionality:** Implement or improve the search filters on `courses.html` and `teachers.html`.
- [ ] **Contact Form:** Add validation to the contact form in `contact.html`.
- [ ] **Animations:** Polish the "Video Hero" and "Roadmap" animations for smoother transitions.

### 3. Teacher Dashboard (Fatima's Focus)
- [ ] **Course Management:** Finalize the "Create New Course" modal functionality and UI.
- [ ] **Charts Integration:** Ensure `Chart.js` in `teacher-dashboard.js` correctly renders data for earnings and engagement.
- [ ] **Tables:** Improve the "My Courses" table responsiveness and adding "Edit/Delete" actions.
- [ ] **Schedule UI:** Polish the "Today's Schedule" section to look more premium.

### 4. Admin & Student Dashboards (Jawad's Focus)
- [ ] **Admin Statistics:** Implement detailed stats and graphs for platform-wide metrics (users, revenue, etc.).
- [ ] **User Management:** Create or polish the UI for managing students and teachers from the admin panel.
- [ ] **Student Progress:** Improve the "Continue Learning" and "Progress Tracking" UI in the student dashboard.
- [ ] **Auth Flow:** Ensure `login.html` and `signup.html` are properly linked with the dashboard redirect logic in `auth.js`.

## 🔄 Git Workflow Rules

1. **Daily Pull:** Always `git pull origin main` before starting work to avoid conflicts.
2. **Commit Often:** Use descriptive commit messages (e.g., `feat: added course filter UI`).
3. **Pull Requests:** When a task is complete, push to your branch and open a PR. **Do not merge directly to main.**
4. **Code Review:** Review each other's design changes to ensure the UI remains cohesive.
